<h1>Spotify in Redux</h1>
<p>Start by working from the Spotify application at the bottom of this page. Today your tasks will be to create a React application from that project and manage its state in Redux.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewrite the application using React, keeping the current functionality unchanged (don't forget the routes to manage the three main screens and the search function in the sidebar)</li>
<li>Once complete, install the necessary packages to implement Redux</li>
<li>When you click on a song, the name and details should appear in the "music player," the section at the bottom of the page that shows the listening controls (use Redux)</li>
<li>Next to each song you will need to add the functionality to like the song. From then on, whenever the song appears, the "like" status should reflect the one saved in Redux</li>
<li>[EXTRA] Save in the Redux store also the search results you get from the API.</li>
<li>[EXTRA] The ability to add songs to other playlists than the normal playback queue</li>
</ul>
